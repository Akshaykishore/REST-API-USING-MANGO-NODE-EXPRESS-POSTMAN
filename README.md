# REST-API-USING-MANGO-NODE-EXPRESS-POSTMAN
This is simple example of getting started with RESTAPI .
Initially check the version of node ,npm and mongo.
you would have installed mongo already but for the use of API you must create a folder named "data" inside the local disk C and inside data create another folder named db.
Now run the mongod file in cmd
Then check this if that comes like this.
Then run nodemon server.js file .
It would be listening to local host .
From that copy the URL and paste it in POSTMAN and do whatever operation you need i would place the sample one over here.
That's it happy coding..
